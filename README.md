# weather-analysis
## Project Description
This project analyzes time-series weather data to identify trends and patterns over multiple years. Using Python and the Pandas library, the analysis explores:
- Temperature variations
- Rainfall distributions
- Relationships between temperature and rainfall.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains monthly weather statistics, including average temperature, total rainfall, and more.
## Dataset
The dataset contains monthly weather statistics for a specific location, spanning multiple years. Key columns include:
- `Year`: Year of observation.
- `Month`: Month of observation (converted to names).
- `tem`: Average temperature (째C) for the month.
- `Rainfall`: Total rainfall (mm) for the month.

## Features
This project performs the following analyses:
1. Displays basic information about the dataset, such as shape, data types, and unique values.
2. Analyzes rainfall and temperature statistics:
   - Average, variance, and standard deviation.
   - Instances of extreme weather conditions (e.g., rainfall > 100mm or temperature > 35째C).
3. Groups data by month and year to calculate trends.
4. Identifies records with specific conditions, such as no rainfall or very high temperatures.
## Results
Key findings from the analysis:
- The standard deviation of rainfall was 32.5mm.
- The variance in temperature was 6.8째C.
- Extreme conditions included rainfall exceeding 200mm and temperatures above 35째C in some months.
